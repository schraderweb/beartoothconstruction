                                    amazing job with the addition to our 100+
                                    year old farm house. They are efficient,
                                    accommodating and add their artistic and
                                    practical vision to the job. They were
                                    able to retain and work around my washer
                                    and dryer which eliminated a major
                                    disruption to my every day life while I
                                    continued to live in my home. The job site
                                    is organized with minimal cleanup on a
                                    daily basis. Thank you CJ!!
