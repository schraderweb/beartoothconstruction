                            When building your Northern Michigan home, it's important to consider a few key factors. For example, think about the climate - what type of roofing materials should you choose? What windows should you install? How reliable is your foundation? What kind of builder should you choose? And, of course, there are always the little details that can make a big difference - like making sure that your house has an efficient heating and cooling system or choosing high-quality fixtures and materials. To help you along the way, we've put together a list of tips that will help you get the most out of your home construction experience. So read on and enjoy learning about the best Northern Michigan home construction tips!

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Consider the climate when choosing roofing materials</h3>
                        <p class=" margin-bottom-10">
                            Choosing the suitable roofing material for your home construction is crucial. Not only will it protect your home from the elements, but it will also withstand the various climate conditions your area may experience. When choosing a roofing material, take into account both peak and average temperatures throughout the year. 

                        </p>
                        <p class=" margin-bottom-10">
                            Additionally, be sure to factor in snow loading - a heavy winter load can cause damage to any type of roof, no matter its construction. Finally, make sure to choose a roofing material that is compatible with the climate in your area. Doing so will help you avoid any potential problems down the line. Happy homebuilding!

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Invest in windows suited to the local climate</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">
                            Northern Michigan weather can be unpredictable, which can lead to costly home construction mishaps. Invest in windows suited to the local climate to ensure your home is built to withstand the elements. Try installing French doors or an air-conditioning unit for summery oases in the north. For colder climates, install wood-frame or double-paned windows to keep your home warm during winter. Additionally, ensure your windows are properly sealed and insulated to save energy costs. And last but not least, make sure your home construction is energy efficient by choosing windows suited to your specific climate.

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Make sure that your foundation is solid</h3>

                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">
                            Home construction in Northern Michigan can be daunting, but with a few simple tips at your disposal, the process will go much smoother. One of the most important things you can do is install insulation in the walls and ceilings. This will help reduce your heating and cooling needs by up to 50%. 

                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">
                            Additionally, replacing old, inefficient appliances with ENERGY STAR versions can help too. By doing this, you'll be saving both money and energy this winter. So don't wait - get started on reducing your home construction needs today!
 
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Never skimp on insulation</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">
                            Northern Michigan homes are built to endure harsh weather conditions, which means that insulation is a must. Make sure to insulate your attic and the joists below your flooring - these areas can often be overlooked. Additionally, make sure you have good airflow throughout your home by installing windows that open wide and using fans to circulate air around the house during cold months. And, of course, don't forget about the foundation! A good foundation will help your home withstand the test of time.
 
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Consider site-built construction instead of modular homes</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">When it comes to home construction, Northern Michigan residents have a few options to choose from. One of the best options is site-built construction, which is more affordable and takes less time to construct. Additionally, modular homes are not as energy efficient, so factors like climate control and heating will be more challenging to achieve. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">Another downside of modular homes is that they're not designed for cold climates, which could cause structural damage in the long run. So, if you're looking for a home that will be able to withstand the colder temperatures of northern Michigan, site-built construction is the better option for you.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Keep an eye out for problems even once your house is finished</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">It's always important to take care of your home - even after it's finished. Make sure to inspect it for any problems even before you move in. If you find any cracks or leaks, fix them now, so they don't get worse and cause more damage. Additionally, make sure all your electrical wiring is up-to-date and properly sealed.</p>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">This is especially important if you're planning on using central heating or cooling; faulty wiring can lead to an unsafe fire. And if you're ever planning on selling your home in the future, get it inspected by a professional to make sure everything is in good condition. Home construction can be a lot of work, but it's well worth it to have a safe and comfortable home during and after.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Build smart, so you don't have to build again</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">
                            When building a home in the northern Michigan area, it's important to know a few things; for starters, insulate your home well - even during the winter months. Additionally, use durable construction materials that will last for years in a cold climate. Finally, create a budget and stick to it - don't overspend just because you can. With these tips, you'll build your home smart and avoid having to build again in the future!
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center margin-bottom-20">Use a contractor with a proven record of performance</h3>
                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">

                        <p class="margin-bottom-10">
                            When building your dream home in Northern Michigan, make sure to focus on energy efficiency.

And don't forget to use Energy Star qualified materials and insulation and air sealing techniques when possible. When you make these smart home construction choices, you're ensuring that your home will stand the test of time and provide you and your family with years of enjoyment!

                                    Construction!!! CJ is doing an
                                    amazing job with the addition to our 100+
                                    year old farm house. They are efficient,
                                    accommodating and add their artistic and
                                    practical vision to the job. They were
                                    able to retain and work around my washer
                                    and dryer which eliminated a major
                                    disruption to my every day life while I
                                    continued to live in my home. The job site
                                    is organized with minimal cleanup on a
                                    daily basis. Thank you CJ!!
