It's also a great opportunity to customize the house exactly according to your lifestyle.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Custom homes tend to be more costly than pre-built spec homes, but they can be tailored to meet your individual needs. Custom houses can be made more accessible for families with disabilities or larger for growing families.</p> <h2>Designing Your Dream Home</h2><p style="font-size: 17px;">Designing your dream home can be an enjoyable and creative endeavor! However, it also involves a great deal of hard work. The first step to take is defining your vision for your new residence.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">A clear vision of how you wish your house to appear will help you avoid making decisions that you later regret. This is especially relevant if you need to hire an architect or builder for the project.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">One of the best ways to express your ideas is by sketching a floor plan for your new house. Start by drawing an easy-to-follow bubble diagram, with each bubble representing one room you wish in your residence.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Once you have your rough floor plan drawn, use straight lines to connect each room. Our kit comes complete with graph paper, a pencil with eraser, and a ruler - so you can get started right away!</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Next, evaluate your family's lifestyle. Are you more focused on relaxation or entertaining? Do you enjoy spending time outdoors? Is energy efficiency a priority for you?</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Finally, take into account the climate in your region. If you live in the Southwestern United States, then it might be beneficial to reduce natural light entering your living space; on the other hand, if it's warmer there is likely a need to maximize it.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">By following these tips, you can begin designing the home of your dreams and creating a space that you and your family will adore. Don't let the process overwhelm you; take it one step at a time! You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll have the house of your dreams ready for you to move into!</p> <h2>Finding the Perfect Lot</h2><p style="font-size: 17px;">Constructing a custom home can be an incredibly exciting and satisfying experience. You have the unique chance to design a house that meets all of your specifications while also showcasing your individual style and taste.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Finding the ideal lot to build on is a crucial step in creating your ideal home. Not every area will offer lots that meet both your desired floor plan and budget, so take time to search around.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">When searching for a lot, you should take into account location, site features and available views. Whether you want an idyllic scene or something more urbane, this will help narrow down your options and simplify the search.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Another factor to consider is zoning laws and restrictions in your area. These can restrict how much building can be done on your lot, the size and design of your house, as well as how it appears from the street.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">When planning your lot layout, you should take into account the soil and slope. A steep slope may make it difficult to build on, while homes may experience issues with foundations and footings.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">When selecting a site for your custom home, proximity to schools, work, shopping and recreation should be taken into consideration. This decision could also have an effect on its potential resale value.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Selecting a lot that has natural drainage of rain and runoff from neighboring properties is essential. Doing so prevents water accumulation around your home's foundation, walkways and driveway - not to mention reduced water bills!</p> <h2>Designing Your Floor Plan</h2><p style="font-size: 17px;">Your custom home floor plan is an integral component of creating the ideal residence. It should be tailored to suit your lifestyle, practicalities and style preferences while accommodating changes in needs over time, such as adding a children's bedroom or office space.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">When designing your home, the initial step is to consider the size and aesthetic of each room. Doing this will enable you to decide how much space should be included in your custom floor plan.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Once you know your space needs, designing your floor plan becomes much simpler. For large families, ensure there is enough room to move around comfortably in each room. An open concept kitchen, living and dining area might work best here as everyone can come together for meals or entertaining together.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">It's also essential to consider whether there are any lot restrictions that require certain floor plans, such as side setbacks and other property lines. These could be determined by the grade or soil of the land.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Additionally, when designing your home's layout, take into account the location of windows to maximize natural lighting. This is especially helpful if you live in Traverse City or Northern Michigan where we experience four seasons and vastly varying amounts of sunshine on different sides.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">If you need a fast way to design and layout your custom home, consider using home design software that allows you to draw floor plans within minutes. Not only will this save you time, but it also ensures the layout of your house is perfect.</p> <h2>Choosing Your Finishes</h2><p style="font-size: 17px;">When building a custom home, it's essential to select the ideal finish selections. This can be an exciting part of the process but also one that may cause stress if not done carefully.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">There are hundreds of decisions that need to be made, from paint color selections to the flooring material in your kitchen and baths. Your builder can help narrow down your options so you make a more informed decision.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Your builder should provide you with a detailed selections guide that includes vendors and showrooms to provide more information on various finishes. This way, you'll know exactly what to choose and how much it will cost.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Once you've narrowed down your choices, the next step is to collaborate with your design team on selecting the overall aesthetic for your home. This could include things like wall texture, cabinet colors and styles, as well as lighting choices.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Experts advise selecting your finishes within a few weeks rather than waiting months, to create an unifying aesthetic throughout the home. Doing this can save time in the long run and keep you on track with your timeline.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">When selecting your finishes, be sure to speak with your custom home builder about budgets and material pricing targets for various items such as flooring, tile, countertops, cabinets etc. Doing this will give you an idea of what price point is realistic for each product and make shopping around town for deals easier.</p> <h2>Building Your Dream Home</h2><p style="font-size: 17px;">Constructing your dream home can be a huge undertaking, but it can also be an incredibly rewarding experience. You have the unique chance to customize every element of your new residence--from its floor plan to its finishes--with ease and satisfaction in mind.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">You have two options for building a custom home: do it all yourself or hire a construction team to take care of everything. No matter which option you select, it is essential to understand what to expect during the construction process.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Begin your project by making a list of goals. Whether you want more time with family, enjoy some quiet space, or get more exercise done, write down what needs you have from home and how you plan on fulfilling them.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">By having clear goals in mind, you'll stay organized and focused throughout the process. Plus, having an idea of what is achievable gives you a better insight into what may work and what won't.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Next, decide the architectural style you wish to include in your home. You have a wide range of choices when it comes to modern, contemporary or eclectic designs - whatever best suits your lifestyle and aesthetic preferences!</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">When planning for your dream home, it is important to take into account both your budget and what you wish to invest. Doing this will help prevent overspending and guarantee you have enough funds available for all expenses involved.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">Create a timeline for the project, so you know how long it'll take to finish your dream house. Furthermore, stay in regular contact with your construction team and stay informed on progress.</p> <p style="font-size: 17px;">After months of hard work and dedication, you will finally be able to move into your dream home! Don't let any obstacles stand in the way of achieving this milestone; it is worth every minute spent creating it so don't give up now.</p>

                                    amazing job with the addition to our 100+
                                    year old farm house. They are efficient,
                                    accommodating and add their artistic and
                                    practical vision to the job. They were
                                    able to retain and work around my washer
                                    and dryer which eliminated a major
                                    disruption to my every day life while I
                                    continued to live in my home. The job site
                                    is organized with minimal cleanup on a
                                    daily basis. Thank you CJ!!
